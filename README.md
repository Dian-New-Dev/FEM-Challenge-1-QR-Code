## Overview

FEM Challenge, mainly about styling and correctly centralizing a QR Code. Responsive.

## My process

- Eyeball the design png for a couple of minutes to determine how many divs the project
will require and what hierarchy they'll have;
- Open VS Code, generate basic HTMl file;
- Create CSS, first line is always:
    * {
      box-sizing: border-box;
    }
- Try to keep track of which elements have layout styling and what children are being
affected;
- Use relative measure units as much as possible;
- Commit and push to git repo when I'm satisfied with the result;
- Edit readme


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

The importance of box-sizing: border-box for responsive designs.


### Continued development

Responsive design is the challenge of the moment. Media querry is my next focus.


### Useful resources

- (https://w3schools.com/) - Barely needed anything else, very complete website.
